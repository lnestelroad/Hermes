    #TODO: define what each field means and its expected data type(s)
    #TODO: Give ranges for ports, broadcast ips, and, liveliness
    general:
    # The general section holds all of the information of the service node which will be passed along to the 
    # Core Catalog Service node during registration and uniquely identify itself in the network. Each node should
    # contain the following information:
        # name: ~
        # ip: localhost
        # log_level: [DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL, ERROR]
        # liveliness: 1000

        # Default
        name: ~
        ip: localhost
        log_level: warning
        liveliness: 1000

    
    sockets:
    # The sockets section of the configuration will hold all of the zmq message exchange pattern specific sockets 
    # needed to transport specific information. Socket information should follow the following format:
        # name:
        #     port: 1234
        #     type: [ROUTER, DEALER, REQ, REP, SUB, PUB, DISH, RADIO, PAIR]
        #     verbose: [True, False]

        # Default

            type: ROUTER
            verbose: false


    handlers:
    # The handlers section holds all of the function callback for any given message command. Message commands are 
    # binary frames of 3-5 bytes and callbacks are callables (closures) defined within the user defined service class.
    # Each entry should consist of key value pairs in the following format:

        # binary_command : callback_function

        # Defaults
        Info_Req: = client_handler
        Registration: = service_registration
        Update: = service_update



    timers:
    # The timers section will hold all of the periodic outgoing message generation functions. After a user given
    # interval, the timer will call a user defined function which either has recurring data to distribute or watches
    # a location for new updates to pass along. Timers information should contain the following attributes:
        # name:
        #     interval: 1000
        #     callback: callback_name
        #     args: 
        #         positional_parameters:
        #             - arg1
        #             - arg2
        #     kwargs: 
        #         keyword_parameters:
        #             kwarg1: value1
        #             kwarg2: value2

        # Defaults
        heartbeats: 
            interval: 1
            callback: = broadcast
            args:
